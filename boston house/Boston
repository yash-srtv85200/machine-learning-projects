# Boston House Price Prediction

This project is focused on predicting house prices in Boston using machine learning techniques.  
The dataset contains various features (such as crime rate, number of rooms, property tax rate, etc.) that influence housing prices.  

## Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Boston Housing dataset.  
- Apply different regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).  
- Compare model performance and evaluate metrics such as RMSE and RÂ².  
- Visualize important features impacting house prices.
